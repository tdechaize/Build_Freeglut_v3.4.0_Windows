# Build_Freeglut_v3.4.0_Windows
Describe in detail how build operational version of Freeglut v3.4.0, Debug or Release, 32 or 64 bits 

Hi,

Here the final result of my test to generate an operational build of Freeglut v3.4.0 on Windows 11 Family 64 bits.

You can read (very long story ...) how I can generate many declinaisons of the package of Freeglut (DLL, static importation library and demos programs)
with many compilers (each very old !!!), or development package. 

I write and describe how you can proceed to operate this in text file.

Please, take time to read the final bilan : "Bilan des générations sur Windows 11 du package Freeglut version 3_4_0.txt". 
17 000 lines to understand. Too long, no, it' s necessary to explain in details the generation by example, illustrated by all results of tests of generations.

After, you can donwload all of the code source, scripts, parameter's file of CMAKE, projects and workspace CB, etc...

Then, you can repeat on your environment all of operations to succeed contruct of Freeglut on Windows. Enjoy.

Thank you, good reading, and if the result you agree, send me mail.

Sincerly.

Thierry DECHAIZE
